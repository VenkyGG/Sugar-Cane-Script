            <p>I love games! Especially first-person shooter games!</p>
        
            <p>Most people play games just for fun (casual gamers), but I play games for the win and the glory. I would consider myself hardcore gamer. At some point I did even considered to go into competitions. However, due to Singapore's strong emphasis on studies, I have to prioritise studies over games.</p>
